              Tape is there for a wide variety of applications.
              Tape is used in almost every industry worldwide.
              Think of building and construction, automotive, medical, maritime, aviation and much more.
              Finding the beginning of the tape, applying it accurately,
              cutting the tape to the right length is time-consuming and requires precision.
              Without tools you need both your hands and also a knife to cut the tape.
              In addition, tape quickly becomes unusable in dusty or humid spaces and drops.
